## Project 1: The Scanner

Name:		Duong Tuan Hoang
Section: 	CMPSCI 4280 - Program Translation Project
VCS:		git
Date:		02/24/2022
Project Option:	Option 3 with FSA table + driver (100 points) 

## Files	
	main.c - the main program to process the input
	testScanner.h, testScanner.c - the testing program
	token.h - header file defining tokenID and token data type
	lex.h - header file defining basic lexical definition
	helper.h - header file containing FSA table and references to operators, keywords, token names and errors
	scanner.h, scanner.c - containing FSA Driver and other helper function
	Makefile 	

## Run the program
	> make
	> To give the program keyboard input, run: ./P0 (remember to Enter and then Ctrl + D 
	to finish the input)
	> To direct the input from a file into program, run: ./P0 < filename
	> To let the program read input from a file, run: ./P0 filename

## Remove all executable and object files

	> make clean

## Description
	> Based on the lexical definition provided, the scanner will parse through the file and 
	export 4 types of token "identifier", "number", "operator", and "EOF".
	> The scanner will automatically skip whitespace and comments surrounded by "##".
	> The token is then printed to the output with its instance, token type, line number and 
	which position this token starts.
	> This scanner can determine 5 errors which is specified in the lex.h. If the program encounter
	error, the error is reported to the screen and then the program is terminated.
